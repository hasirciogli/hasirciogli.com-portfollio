## I'm Not a Standard Developer

For me, coding is not a profession, it's a **craft**.

I reject the "just make it work" mentality that most developers have. For me, it's not enough for code to just work; it also needs to be **elegant, efficient, and future-oriented**. I am an architect who builds performant and scalable systems in the digital world, thought through to the finest detail.

## The Perfectionist Obsession

I obsess over code — and I'm proud of it.

I don't just solve the problem. I don't sleep until I find the **most optimized, most performant, and most secure** version of that solution. Even a millisecond delay is a defeat for me. This perfectionist obsession is actually a reflection of my respect for the user.

```go
// Bad: Just making it work
func GetUser(id int) User {
    // Direct database query in handler
    // No caching, no error handling
    return db.Query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?", id)
}

// Good: Obsessing over the details
func GetUser(ctx context.Context, id int) (*User, error) {
    // Check cache first
    if cached := cache.Get(ctx, userCacheKey(id)); cached != nil {
        return cached, nil
    }

    // Query with timeout and proper error handling
    user, err := userRepo.FindByID(ctx, id)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("failed to fetch user: %w", err)
    }

    // Cache for future requests
    cache.Set(ctx, userCacheKey(id), user, 5*time.Minute)

    return user, nil
}
```

Every line matters. Every function signature is a contract. Every error path is considered.

## Building Earthquake-Resistant Skyscrapers

I don't just stack bricks on top of each other; I lay the foundation of **earthquake-resistant skyscrapers** that will stand for years.

**Clean Architecture**, **SOLID principles** — these aren't just buzzwords for me, they're my life philosophy. Under every line of code I write lies not just logic, but a vision.

### The Foundation Matters

Most developers rush to build features. I start by asking:

- How will this scale to 100,000 users?
- What happens when this service goes down?
- Can a junior developer understand this code in 6 months?
- Will this architecture still make sense in 5 years?

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│         Presentation Layer          │  ← Clean, simple interfaces
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│         Application Layer           │  ← Business logic
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│           Domain Layer              │  ← Core entities
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│       Infrastructure Layer          │  ← Database, APIs, etc.
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Each layer has a purpose. Each boundary is protected. Each dependency points inward.

## Conscious Technology Choices

I tried popular paths like TypeScript/Next.js, but **consciously abandoned them** because I couldn't foresee the future.

My choice of **Go** isn't just a language preference; it's because it represents the philosophy of **performance, simplicity, and scalability**. Instead of chasing trends, I invest in technologies that will still be relevant ten years from now.

### Why Go?

1. **Performance**: Compiled, statically-typed, concurrent by design
2. **Simplicity**: No classes, no inheritance, no magic
3. **Scalability**: Built for distributed systems from day one
4. **Longevity**: Backed by Google, stable API, backward compatible

```go
// This is all you need for a concurrent, production-ready HTTP server
func main() {
    mux := http.NewServeMux()
    mux.HandleFunc("/health", healthCheck)

    server := &http.Server{
        Addr:         ":8080",
        Handler:      mux,
        ReadTimeout:  10 * time.Second,
        WriteTimeout: 10 * time.Second,
        IdleTimeout:  120 * time.Second,
    }

    log.Fatal(server.ListenAndServe())
}
```

No frameworks. No abstractions. Just code that works and will continue to work.

## User-Centric Perfectionism

All this "obsessing" has one purpose: **To provide users with a fast, reliable, and seamless experience**.

My perfectionism is actually my customer satisfaction obsession. Because coding is an art form for me, and like every work of art, the systems I create must add value to users' lives.

### What This Means in Practice

- **Performance**: Sub-200ms API response times, not "good enough"
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime with graceful degradation, not "it usually works"
- **Security**: Defense in depth, not "we haven't been hacked yet"
- **Monitoring**: Observability from day one, not "let's add logs later"

Every millisecond matters. Every edge case is considered. Every failure mode is handled.

## The Five-Year Principle

> "I write code thinking not just about today, but about what a system will look like five years from now. Every line of code is a step taken to prevent a future problem or create an opportunity."

This is my guiding principle. When I write code, I ask:

1. **Will this scale?** Not to 1000 users, but to 1 million
2. **Can this be maintained?** Not by me, but by someone who joins next year
3. **Is this testable?** Not just unit tests, but integration and load tests
4. **Is this observable?** Can I debug this at 3 AM when production is down?
5. **Is this secure?** Not against script kiddies, but against sophisticated attacks

### Real Example: Database Design

```sql
-- Bad: Quick and dirty
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    email VARCHAR(255)
);

-- Good: Thinking five years ahead
CREATE TABLE users (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    uuid UUID NOT NULL UNIQUE DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    email VARCHAR(320) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    email_verified BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    deleted_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
    CONSTRAINT email_format CHECK (email ~* '^[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}$')
);

CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;
CREATE INDEX idx_users_created_at ON users(created_at DESC);

-- Trigger for updated_at
CREATE TRIGGER update_users_updated_at
    BEFORE UPDATE ON users
    FOR EACH ROW
    EXECUTE FUNCTION update_updated_at_column();
```

The second approach:

- Scales to billions of rows (BIGSERIAL)
- Supports distributed systems (UUID)
- Handles soft deletes (deleted_at)
- Validates data at database level
- Optimized for common queries
- Tracks changes automatically

## The Cost of Craft

Yes, building this way takes more time upfront. But the payoff is exponential:

- **Fewer bugs** in production
- **Faster feature development** after the foundation is solid
- **Lower maintenance costs** over time
- **Easier onboarding** for new developers
- **Better sleep** knowing the system won't randomly crash

I've seen too many "quick and dirty" solutions become million-dollar technical debt nightmares.

## My Commitment

When you work with me, you get:

1. **Production-ready code** from day one
2. **Architecture** that scales
3. **Tests** that give confidence
4. **Documentation** that makes sense
5. **Monitoring** that catches issues before users do

Not because I'm trying to be perfect. But because this is the **only way I know how to build**.

## The Bottom Line

Coding is a craft. Systems are art. Users deserve excellence.

I don't build software to just check boxes. I build systems that **last, scale, and delight**.

That's not standard developer work. That's **craftsmanship**.

_If this philosophy resonates with you, [let's work together](/contact). If you think it's overkill, that's fine — there are plenty of developers who will build you a "quick solution." Just don't call me when it breaks in production._
